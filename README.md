# List

## what the program does
* This a simple program that ask user for thing they have watch(like Movies, TVShows or Anime) and creates a list.
* It starts with name, then genera, type, what season the show came out it, total episodes the show has and how many of them are watched, then ask what year it came out in and how many season are there of the show and then finally ask the use to choose which category the show belongs in.

## list of concepts used?
* Enum: the program uses enum to categorize the shows.
* overloaded operator: I overloaded the friend operator for pretty printing, and constructors as well.
* strut: for all the previous mention dates like; Name, genera, type, and ect...
* Creating header and cpp files for each class.

## Future Work
* Next I want to read it form website instead of a csv file, so I wouldn't have to manually creat a data of all the anime I will watch/have watched.
